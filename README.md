This package contains functions designed for processing and analyzing
aerial survey DAS data (AirDAS) generated by the Southwest Fisheries
Science Center using one of the following programs: PHOCOENA, CARETTA,
or TURTLE (such as TURTLEP or TURTLE4D). Functionality includes reading
AirDAS data into a data frame, processing this data (extracting state
and condition information for each AirDAS event), and summarizing
sighting and effort information. Plans for future development include:
generating tables summarizing the information in the AirDAS file,
plotting AirDAS data, and generating files needed for doing density
estimation. Learn more in `vignette("swfscAirDAS")`

## Installation

You can install the released version of swfscAirDAS from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("swfscAirDAS")
```

You can install the developmental version of swfscAirDAS from
[GitHub](https://github.com/). To use the development version of
swfscAirDAS, it is recommended to install the development version of
[swfscDAS](https://smwoodman.github.io/swfscDAS/index.html) as well:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("smwoodman/swfscDAS", build_vignettes = TRUE)
remotes::install_github("smwoodman/swfscAirDAS", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

Please contact the developer if you have any issues.

## AirDAS format and checks

swfscAirDAS accepts AirDAS data from several different programs, and
thus in several different formats: PHOCOENA, CARETTA, and TURTLE. You
can download PDFs describing these formats at the following links:

  - [PHOCOENA data format
    PDF](https://github.com/smwoodman/swfscAirDAS/blob/master/inst/AirDAS_Format_PHOCOENA.pdf)
  - [CARETTA data format
    PDF](https://github.com/smwoodman/swfscAirDAS/blob/master/inst/AirDAS_Format_CARETTA.pdf)
  - [TURTLE data format
    PDF](https://github.com/smwoodman/swfscAirDAS/blob/master/inst/AirDAS_Format_TURTLE.pdf)

These PDFs are also included in the package; see
[`airdas_format_pdf`](https://smwoodman.github.io/swfscAirDAS/reference/airdas_format_pdf.html)
for more details.

In addition, the package contains the function
[`airdas_check`](https://smwoodman.github.io/swfscAirDAS/reference/airdas_check.html),
which checks whether the provided file adheres to expected format of the
provided file type. This function is designed to 1) be used for data
QA/QC after performing a survey and 2) ensure the data format meets all
of the assumptions made by the rest of the functions in the package. A
PDF describing the format checks is included in the package; you can
also [`download the PDF
here`](https://github.com/smwoodman/swfscAirDAS/blob/master/inst/AirDAS_check.pdf)
